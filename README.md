# RareSkills Work

Welcome to my RareSkills repo. Contained within is all of my work for the course.

Thank you in advance for any time spent reviewing and providing feedback based on this, your time and support is greatly appreciated!

## Repo Structure

There is a folder for each week with the naming pattern `weekn`.

Each folder will contain the following:
- A README giving a brief overview of the weeks work
- Any markdown files with answers to that weeks questions
- A forge/foundry project with code and contracts for that weeks work

Please feel free to provide feedback on this structure, I am happy to update it in anyway that makes it easier for you to read and review.

All the best,

Tom! :)
