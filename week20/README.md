# Week 20

- [My notes on ECDSA](./ecdsa/ecdsa.pdf)

- [x]  Given a random point *n*, is *n* a valid point on the sepc265k1 curve? Use any language you like. Your function should take *****n***** and return true or false. **Do not use a library to implement this**.
  - [My solution](./sepc265k1.py)
- [ ]  Use the code in the blog post above to generate an address that starts with 0x0000â€¦ (there 2 bytes of leading zeros). Be very careful where you get your randomness from!
- [ ]  Capture the ether [Fuzzy Identitiy](https://capturetheether.com/challenges/accounts/fuzzy-identity/)
