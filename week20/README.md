# Week 20

- [My notes on ECDSA](./ecdsa/ecdsa.pdf)

- [x]  Given a random point *n*, is *n* a valid point on the sepc265k1 curve? Use any language you like. Your function should take *****n***** and return true or false. **Do not use a library to implement this**.
  - [My solution](./sepc265k1.py)
- [x]  Use the code in the blog post above to generate an address that starts with 0x0000â€¦ (there 2 bytes of leading zeros). Be very careful where you get your randomness from!
  - [My solution](./generate-keys/generate-keys.py)
```bash
# Private Key: (don't steal plz only like ~15 ETH on here and a few k OP)
0xbd57d237176728d4fa5cb5bab8b90a57b1bc33d3787c059437845cd98fdf2b0a
# Eth Address:
0x000094d2b4a0c2cf043bb2951237264c13c3cf52
```
