# Week 2 Work

Due to a crisis at work (vulnerability detected in our smart contracts ðŸ˜±) I have not had the same amount of time I would usually want to invest into this work.

Hence I have not been as thorough as I would have liked to be.

Luckily we are able to prevent the exploit at work as it was detected internally and we acted quickly, paused the contracts, then I just had to urgently develop the fix, work with auditers at short notice to verify the fix and then deploy it so as to minimize downtime and the community concern.
