# Wrapped NFTs

In the reading, wrapped NFTS were used to create tradeable version of an NFT, that can be redeemed for the underlying NFT at any time, but avoid royalty fees during transfers, allowing control of the system to taken away from the original NFT contracts.

## Besides the examples listed in the code and the reading, what might the wrapped NFT pattern be used for?

They can be used for DeFi apps that use NFTs for various purposes:
- Lending NFTs
- Borrowing NFTs
- Using NFTs as collateral for loans
- Earning yield on NFTs by supplying them to protocol

By wrapping the NFTs, it makes it possible to interact with using other standards than ERC721, say ERC20 - making them fungible again using a baseline floor price.

This makes it easy to transfer large numbers of NFTs in a single transaction

You could also wrap an NFT to add any extra functionality you can imagine - say making it interoperable with a certain web3 game.

I could imagine you could also to make a web of relationships between NFTs, I am imagining adding the ability to "fuse" NFTs, so then they have to be transferred together, creating NFT "families". Then extending the web3 game idea, I can imagine that you could then get these "families" of NFTs to "fight" and then one family if it wins could take ownership of the other.

I am just making up ideas now though.
